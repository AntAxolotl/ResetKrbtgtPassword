# Reset Krbtgt Password Script

## Important Warning
Rotating the krbtgt password in Active Directory is a highly sensitive procedure. Any missteps—such as failing to verify replication, not performing thorough testing, or rotating the password on an incorrect schedule—can cause severe authentication disruptions, lock out users, break trust relationships, and compromise domain security. Always ensure you have a verified backup, a tested rollback plan, and have thoroughly reviewed Microsoft’s best practices before making any changes to the krbtgt account password. Use this script and related processes at your own risk.
